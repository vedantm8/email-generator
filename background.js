// A minimal background script.
// In this setup, the content script directly handles the modal and API call.
// This background script primarily exists to ensure the extension is always 'on'
// and can be expanded for more complex features (e.g., persistent storage, complex messaging).

console.log("Gmail AI Email Assistant background script loaded.");

// No specific message listeners needed for this simplified flow,
// as the content script is self-contained for the generation process.
